machine learning was defined in 1959 by arthur samuel as the "field of study that gives computers
the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." this means imbuing knowledge to
machines without hard-coding it. from what i have personally found, people outside the
programming community mainly believe machine intelligence is hard-coded, completely unaware
of the reality of the field. one of the largest challenges i had with machine learning was the
abundance of material on the learning part. you can find formulas, charts, equations, and a bunch of
theory on the topic of machine learning, but very little on the actual "machine" part, where you
actually program the machine and run the algorithms on real data. this is mainly due to the history.
in the 50s, machines were quite weak, and in very little supply, which remained very much the case
for half a century. machine learning was relegated to being mainly theoretical and rarely actually
employed. the support vector machine (svm), for example, was created by vladimir vapnik in
the soviet union in 1963, but largely went unnoticed until the 90s when vapnik was scooped out
the soviet union to the united states by bell labs. the neural network was conceived in the
1940's, but computers at the time were nowhere near powerful enough to run them well, and have
not been until the relatively recent times.
